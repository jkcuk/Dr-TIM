How to import TIM from the repository into Eclipse

Dr TIM lives in a GIT repository

1) Get github account (at https://github.com/)
2) e-mail username to me
3) I will add you as a "Collaborator" on the project (at https://github.com/jkcuk/Dr-TIM/settings/collaboration)
4) In Eclipse, Import... (by right-clicking in the Package Explorer) > Projects from Git with the following settings:
Location
URI: https://github.com/jkcuk/Dr-TIM.git
Host: github.com
Repository path: /jkcuk/Dr-TIM.git
Connection
Protocol: https
Port: 
Authentication
User: <your Git user name>
Password: <your Git password>
Store in Secure Store: yes
5) Hopefully, the next few steps make sense...

OLD: Subversion repository

If a new user wants to do this, I need to have given them access to the source code at https://sourceforge.net/p/timray/admin/groups/ .
Eclipse needs to have the subversion plugin installed (Eclipse subversion plugin:  http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/ ; install in Eclipse by selecting "Install New Software�" in the "Help" menu; select one of the standard Eclipse software servers, ...)

Anyone who has the right permissions on sourceforge can then do the following:

*  Right click somewhere in the project explorer and click �Import�
*  Select the �SVN� folder then �Project from SVN�.
*  Click Next.
*  Click �create a new repository location�.
*  Enter the URL as �https://svn.code.sf.net/p/timray/code'
*  Enter your username and password in the authentication panel below
*  Click Next.
*  If all goes well, you�ll see a page with �Head Revision� selected � leave it as that and click Finish.
*  Eclipse will download some project information and then show you a �Check Out As� window. It should have detected the Eclipse .project file on the SVN server and won�t let you �check out as a project configured using the New Project Wizard�. The only radio buttons you should be able to select are �Check out as a folder into existing project� and �Check out as a project with the name specified:�. You should choose the latter, and enter the project name as �TIM�. Leave the revision as the �Head� revision and click Finish.
*  Eclipse will then download the project files and place them in a new project in the project explorer.
*  Voila, the project is now (hopefully) set up properly.
